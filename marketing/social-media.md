# CEREBERUS Social Media Campaign

## Tone Guide

Understated confidence. Technical credibility. No buzzwords. No "revolutionary" or "cutting-edge" or "next-gen." Let the features speak. Think Porsche, not Monster Energy. Every claim is specific and verifiable. Numbers over adjectives.

### Post 1 — Product Introduction (Carousel)

**Visual concept:** Dark terminal aesthetic. Slide 1: CEREBERUS logo on black with subtle grid overlay. Slide 2: Terminal output showing Commander Bond scanning. Slide 3: Sword Protocol neutralization log. Slide 4: Dashboard screenshot mockup with threat board showing NEUTRALIZED states in green.

**Caption:**
Meet Cereberus.

50 detection rules. 6 live threat feeds. Autonomous response in under 1 second.

Not another dashboard. An autonomous defense system that detects, decides, and acts — without waiting for a human in the loop.

Built by engineers who got tired of alert fatigue.

### Post 2 — Commander Bond Feature Spotlight

**Visual concept:** Split-screen. Left: traditional SOC analyst drowning in 10,000 daily alerts (illustrated/stylized). Right: Clean terminal showing "Commander Bond ... SCANNING / Threats Neutralized: 847" with calm, controlled aesthetic.

**Caption:**
The average SOC receives 10,000 alerts per day. 62% of analysts report fatigue.

Commander Bond evaluates every alert autonomously. Behavioral baselines. Threat correlation. Graduated response.

No queue. No ticket. No "we'll get to it."

### Post 3 — Technical Deep Dive (Educational)

**Visual concept:** Clean diagram on dark background showing the Cereberus detection pipeline: Raw Event -> 50 Rules -> Bond Evaluation -> Sword Protocol -> Neutralized. Each stage labeled with timing (< 1ms, < 10ms, < 100ms, < 1s).

**Caption:**
From raw event to neutralized threat in under 1 second.

The pipeline:
1. Event captured via Windows EventBus
2. 50 detection rules evaluate in parallel
3. Commander Bond correlates with behavioral baseline
4. Sword Protocol matches and executes policy
5. Original alert marked NEUTRALIZED

Total time: < 1 second. Total human intervention: zero.

### Post 4 — Before/After (Social Proof Format)

**Visual concept:** Two panels, clearly labeled BEFORE and AFTER. Before: Red-tinted timeline showing "Threat detected -> 46 minutes -> Remediated." After: Green-tinted timeline showing "Threat detected -> 1 second -> NEUTRALIZED."

**Caption:**
46 minutes vs. 1 second.

That's the difference between a contained event and a breach notification.

Sword Protocol doesn't wait for shift change, doesn't need caffeine, doesn't have a ticket queue.

It evaluates. It decides. It acts.

### Post 5 — Architecture Showcase

**Visual concept:** Minimal tech stack diagram. Dark background, clean lines. FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + React/TypeScript + PyTorch. 6 middleware layers shown as concentric rings. "Zero shell=True" badge prominent.

**Caption:**
The stack behind Cereberus:

- FastAPI (async Python backend)
- SQLAlchemy with 37 tables (WAL mode)
- React + TypeScript (type-safe frontend)
- PyTorch (ML inference)
- 6 middleware layers (CORS, CSRF, WAF, Rate Limiting, Audit, Request ID)
- Zero shell=True calls. Ever.

Every design decision has a reason. Every line of detection logic is readable Python.

### Instagram Ad 2 — Conversion

**Visual concept:** Terminal screenshot showing a real Sword Protocol execution log with green NEUTRALIZED status. Clean, no clutter. Professional.

**Caption:**
While you were reading this, Cereberus neutralized another threat.

Commander Bond + Sword Protocol = autonomous defense that actually works.

### Tweet 1 — Launch Announcement

the cybersecurity tool that doesn't create more work for you

cereberus: 50 detection rules, 6 threat feeds, autonomous response in < 1 second

no dashboards to babysit. no alert queues. just neutralized threats.

---

### Tweet 2 — Technical Thread (5 posts)

1/ How Cereberus handles a threat — from detection to neutralization in < 1 second. A thread.

2/ Raw event enters via Windows EventBus. 50 detection rules evaluate in parallel — process anomalies, network threats, file integrity, privilege escalation, lateral movement, and 9 more categories.

All rules are readable Python. No proprietary query languages.

3/ Commander Bond correlates the detection with behavioral baselines and 6 live threat intelligence feeds. It doesn't just check "is this IP bad" — it checks "is this behavior anomalous for THIS system at THIS time."

Adaptive intervals. Ensemble scoring. Full explainability.

4/ If severity meets policy thresholds, Sword Protocol fires. Escalation chain: kill process -> block IP -> quarantine file -> isolate network.

Each policy has a codename, rate limiting, and cooldown periods. Dry-run mode for validation before production.

5/ Result: original threat alert marked NEUTRALIZED on the Threat Board. Green border. Bond's codename stamped on it. Full audit trail in the Sword execution log.

Total human intervention: zero.

That's Cereberus.

### Tweet 3 — Stat-Based

Average SOC: 10,000 alerts/day, 62% analyst fatigue, 46-minute mean response time.

Cereberus: autonomous triage, zero fatigue, 1-second response time.

Not a comparison. A replacement for the parts that shouldn't need humans.

---

### Tweet 4 — Engineering-Focused

"zero shell=True" is not a feature. it's a minimum standard.

cereberus has it. plus 6 middleware layers, RBAC, CSRF protection, path traversal validation, log rotation, and WAL-mode SQLite.

security tools should be secure. novel concept.

---

### Tweet 5 — Sword Protocol Spotlight

Sword Protocol codenames: THUNDERBALL, GOLDFINGER, MOONRAKER...

Each one maps to an automated response policy with escalation chains, rate limits, and dry-run mode.

When Commander Bond detects a match, Sword strikes. Process killed. IP blocked. Alert neutralized.

Under 1 second.

---

### Tweet 6 — Transparency/Philosophy

Every detection rule in Cereberus is readable Python. Not a DSL. Not a proprietary format. Not "powered by AI" with no explanation.

50 rules. You can read them, modify them, understand exactly what triggers a response.

Transparency isn't a feature. It's the default.

---

### Tweet 7 — For Business Owners

If your incident response playbook starts with "page the on-call," you don't have automated response.

Cereberus handles containment in < 1 second. Your team handles the post-mortem over coffee.

---

### Tweet 8 — Product Update

Cereberus v1.6.0:

- Bond now auto-resolves alerts that Sword neutralizes
- NEUTRALIZED visual state on Threat Board
- Global button feedback across 40+ UI controls
- 34-point automated security verification checklist
- 21 integration + security tests

Shipping quality, not features.

### X Ad 1 — Awareness

Your SIEM sends you 10,000 alerts a day.

Cereberus sends you zero. Because it already handled them.
